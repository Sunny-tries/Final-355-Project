# Final-355-Project
## Overview
This repository contains my final project for the CS 355 Internet and Web Technologies class. The project showcases my skills in integrating two APIs into a Node.js server application, focusing particularly on synchronous communication and authentication mechanisms.

## Project Highlights
- Synchronous API Integration: Demonstrates the ability to coordinate API calls in a strict sequence, ensuring reliable data handling without race conditions.
- Authentication Mastery: Features OAuth authentication methods, emphasizing my understanding of secure API access without relying on third-party libraries.
- Low-level HTTP Communication: By avoiding external modules, I delved deep into Node.js's core libraries, enhancing my proficiency in HTTP/HTTPS protocols, JSON manipulation, and the foundational concepts of asynchronous 
 programming.
- Educational Focus: The project was evaluated based on my grasp of HTTPS, JSON, and a fundamental understanding of Node.js, rather than the practicality or design of the application.

This project is a testament to my technical growth and understanding of key web technologies, achieved through hands-on experience via academic challenges.
